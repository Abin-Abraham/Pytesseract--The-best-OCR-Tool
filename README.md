# Pytesseract--The-best-OCR-Tool

Humans perceive text on an image as text and can read it. By using an OCR tool, we transfer the same intelligence to the computer. Pytesseract is such a helping tool in this field. Pytesseact or elaborately Python tesseract is an open source library developed by google for the sake of optical character recognition. The Library is so much user friendly and it can be used in variety of fields. In my small exploration, this is the best OCR tool that i worked with. 
Speaking about the process of installation, we could use the 'pip' installation process for this library.

$ pip install pytesseract
